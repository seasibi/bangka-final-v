Key UI rules to follow are:

Study the system’s current input types and reuse consistent design elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and control types (e.g., text fields, toggle buttons, date pickers).

Keep the interface simple and focus on essential features, avoiding clutter or unnecessary complexity.

Apply inline validation selectively based on input type and context:

Provide instant feedback once input is unambiguous or after leaving the field.

Allow flexible input methods where possible, validating for correctness without overly restricting user input style.

Use clear visual cues (color, icons, or text) to indicate valid or invalid states.

Ensure accessibility and responsive design so the UI remains user-friendly across devices.

Maintain consistent button layouts, labels, and error messages to build familiarity and reduce user learning curve.

Design validation logic thoughtfully to handle dynamic fields or dependencies without overwhelming the user.
