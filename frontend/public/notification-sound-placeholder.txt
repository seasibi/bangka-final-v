If you're seeing console warnings about a missing notification sound:

The app will automatically use a fallback beep sound generated by the Web Audio API.
This is working as designed - no action needed.

To add a custom notification sound:
1. Download or create a notification sound (MP3 format)
2. Name it "notification-sound.mp3"
3. Place it in this public directory

The fallback beep will continue to work even without a custom sound file.
